# Next steps for enhancing the backend:

Implement video processing logic (using YouTube/TikTok APIs)
Add ingredient recognition (using AI/ML services)
Integrate with a maps API for store locations
Add proper error handling and validation
Add configuration management
Add tests

# This implementation provides:

YouTube video processing
Store finding using Google Maps API
Basic distance calculations
Configuration management
Proper error handling

# Next steps could be:

Add proper ingredient extraction using AI/ML
Add caching for API responses
Add user location detection
Add tests
Add proper logging
Add rate limiting

# Create a .env file in your project root:

YOUTUBE_API_KEY=your_youtube_api_key
MAPS_API_KEY=your_google_maps_api_key
PORT=8080

# I have implemented AI-powered ingredient extraction using OpenAI's GPT-4 model. The system now:

Extracts the video description from YouTube
Sends it to OpenAI's API for intelligent ingredient parsing
Returns a structured list of ingredients with quantities


# I have implemented the following improvements to your backend:

Added caching using go-cache to store API responses
Added user location detection using IP geolocation
Added comprehensive logging middleware
Added rate limiting (100 requests per minute per IP)
Added basic tests for the video handler
